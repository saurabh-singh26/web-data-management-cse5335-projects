Description:

The goal of this project is to create a web mashup that combines two web services: Google Maps and the Yelp API for Developers, using JavaScript and AJAX. After you center your Google Map to a geographical area and enter some terms, such as "Indian Restaurant", your application will find the best matches (eg, the best Indian restaurants) inside you map area, it will mark their location on the map, and will display some information about these restaurants on the web page.
